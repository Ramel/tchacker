Tchacker is a module for the Ikaaro CMS.

This branch (0.62_progressbar) is tested with:

  - itools: master-venv-0.62-sd-26262
  - ikaaro:  progressbar
  - thickbox:  master
  - videoencoding: master

Tested with Nginx > 1.7 because it has a new feature to pass the Posted data directly to the proxied server, aka Ikaaro.
Then Ikaaro seems to support the upload of big images better than with the previous Nginx version which sometimes lost the Posted data somewhere.

In Django it exist:

And the other solution before Nginx 1.7 are:
